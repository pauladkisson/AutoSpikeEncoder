# AutoSpikeEncoder
This project implements an ensemble of autoencoders for automatic neural spike sorting.

AutoSpikeEncoder was presented in the Johns Hopkins University Computer Science 482/682 Poster Session, where it won Intuitive Surgical Runner-up Best Project Award.  The presentation can be found [here](https://github.com/pauladkisson/AutoSpikeEncoder/blob/main/IntuitiveSurgicalPosterSession.pptx.pdf).

A full description of the model and results can be found [here](https://github.com/pauladkisson/AutoSpikeEncoder/blob/main/final_project_report.pdf).
